                                            <p>Eight years ago we set out to create a series of awards that were unique. We wanted to impartially identify the very best in the game, judged by experts who could draw on real-life experiences to inform their vote. They had to be people with unrivalled knowledge and passion for travel and food. They had to be people like you. Unlike other industry awards, ours are entirely nominated and voted on by Food and Travel readers.</p>
                                            <p>Your first nominations are in and we are pleased to reveal the shortlist. <a href="https://foodandtravel.com/subscribe">Click here</a> to keep up to date with the latest news from the worlds of food, drink and travel by getting the latest issue delivered straight to your door.
